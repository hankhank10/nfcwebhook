# nfcwebhook
Use an NFC tag to prompt a webhook

Simple script which uses the the <a href="https://github.com/nfcpy/nfcpy">nfcpy</a> library to call the webhook contained in the presented NFC tag

Before using you will need to install nfcpy using the following code:

<code>pip install -U nfcpy</code>
<code>python -m nfc</code>


This is a trimmed down version of my <a href="https://github.com/hankhank10/vinylemulator">vinylemulator</a> project which uses NFC tags to play spotify playlists or albums over Sonos.
